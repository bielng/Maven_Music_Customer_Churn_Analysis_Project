#  Maven Music Customer Churn Analysis 

Welcome to the **Maven Music Customer Churn Analysis Project**! This repository contains all the materials needed for exploring, cleaning, and analyzing customer data, listening habits, and churn rates. Let's dive in!

---

##  **Project Overview**

Maven Music provided datasets about their customers, listening history, and sessions. This project aims to:

-  Understand customer behavior and listening patterns.
-  Investigate why customers churn.
-  Prepare a dataset for predictive modeling.

##  **Key Insights**

###  **Cancellation Insights**

- Customers with discounts have a **higher cancellation rate** (85.7%) compared to those without discounts.
- Customers with **fewer listening sessions** are more likely to cancel.

###  **Listening Behavior**

- **Pop music lovers** show higher churn rates.
- Podcasts listening has **no significant correlation** with cancellations.

---

##  **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**

### 🧹 **Data Cleaning**

- Fixed typos in `Subscription Rate` (e.g., corrected $99.99 to $9.99).
- Standardized genres (e.g., combined `Pop` and `Pop Music`).
- Filled missing values for `Subscription Plan` with `Basic (Ads)`.

### 🛠 **Feature Engineering**

-  **Number of Sessions**: Unique sessions per customer.
-  **Percent Pop**: Percentage of Pop music listened.
-  **Percent Podcasts**: Percentage of Comedy and True Crime podcasts.

---

##  **Visualizations**

Check the  `Images` folder for insightful visualizations like:

- Bar charts comparing cancellation rates for customers with/without discounts.
- Histograms showing the distribution of listening sessions.
- Pair plots exploring feature relationships.

---

##  **Results**

- Discounts are strongly correlated with cancellations.
- Engaged customers (more sessions) are less likely to churn.
- Genre preferences influence customer retention rates.
